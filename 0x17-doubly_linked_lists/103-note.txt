* the usecase of the 'keygen' w/ the 'crackme5' program indicates that the keygen is a part of the program,
	'crackme5' take a username, generates the password & compare it to the given password

* since the program generates the same password for same user each time,
	& with the same length (6) for all users => the program is a hasher

* using debugging techniques (gdb, ltrace, ...):
	the program uses 6 different functions (f1, f2, ..., f6) to create & append each of the password characters

* some functions are implemented directly in the main routine,
	because betty style don't allow more than 5 functions per file

* use reverse engineering to re-implement each function !
